Face Localizer
--------------

Goal: derive a GP that can determine the existence and location
(i.e. the bounding box of) a human face in an image.

Programming Environment: Java. Issue of GP representation.

Decisions:

  Representation
    grammar? (ELF, TAG?)
    operators - whoo boy.
      standard ones ?

    output: set of rectangles, possibly empty

  Selection
  
  Crossover/Mutation

  Population Size

  Fitness
