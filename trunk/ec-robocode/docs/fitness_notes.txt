Run #4

Fitness change - reduce magnitude of scan efficiency by clamping the minimum revolutions to 1 (instead of 0.0001).
Ok never mind. We shall do this: record the total time steps of a battle, and make ratio of scans to total steps. If they were
perfectly efficient, then the value would be 1. This allows us to scale freely.
