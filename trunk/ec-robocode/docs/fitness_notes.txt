Run #4

Fitness change - reduce magnitude of scan efficiency by clamping the minimum revolutions to 1 (instead of 0.0001).
Ok never mind. We shall do this: record the total time steps of a battle, and make ratio of scans to total steps. If they were
perfectly efficient, then the value would be 1. This allows us to scale freely.


// from what? endogenous????
gp_395_11257 - beat ramfire (small margin)


Run #5
+ add the mySpeed node, currentvector (back in) and goingforward
+ modified fitness to give bonus on shorter battles
- terrible performance

in general, been seeing a ridiculous amount of similar behavior, behavior convergence?

Run #6
+ remove battle length
- run with slightly more mutation? (0.8 crossover, 0.1 mutation -- wait for run 7!)
- remove random seeding? (next run?)
+ add a small bonus for survival?
